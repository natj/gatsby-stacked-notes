## Code Comment Guidelines

To maintain code readability and conciseness, please adhere to the following guidelines when adding comments:

1.  **Short and Descriptive:** Comments should be brief but clearly explain the *why* and *what* of the code.
2.  **Avoid Redundancy:** Do not state the obvious. The code should speak for itself where possible.
3.  **No Unnecessary Phrases:** Avoid filler phrases such as:
    *   "This is a simple module for..." (Instead, just "A simple module for...")
    *   "This function is used to..." (Instead, "Calculates X by doing Y.")
    *   "Here we are checking for..." (Instead, "Checks for...")
    *   "The following code does..." (Instead, directly explain what it does.)
4.  **Focus on Logic:** Explain complex logic, edge cases, or design decisions that are not immediately apparent from the code itself.
5.  **Maintain React Context (if applicable):** When explaining React components, hooks, or context, briefly describe their purpose and how they integrate into the React lifecycle or component tree.
